We are Team-Reportica. In this team is Amantle Mashele and Nombulelo Moepi. We are currently second year students pursuing Bachelor of Computing degrees, majoring in Business Intelligence at Belgium Campus ITversity.

Our idea tackles challenge 2. It is based on trying to incentivize consumers into saving water. The incentive will be in the form of issuing the consumers with a calculated discounted bus trip in correlation with the amount of water saved over a specified period.

We are yet to formulate the calculation system.
The aim of this idea is to not only encourage more people to make a conscious effort in trying to stay below the maximum water usage permitted in each household but to also encourage the use of regulated public transport which will aid in reduction of air pollution.

Buses use a card system in which a userâ€™s personal details, such as their IDs, are stored. If more people make use of public buses instead of taxis and their own cars, effective tracking can be done in the occurrence of a COVID-19 exposure case.
